This is an advanced version of my homepage lab where it is more interactive and more stylish. Using cs50ide, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap is embeded into this project. 

Challenges:
1) Carousel in music.html was originally larger than how it was shown in the video.
2) I had trouble making the JavaScript for the quiz.html.

How I resolved:
1) I did more research on Bootstrap and figured how to resize it down.
2) I used some of my Python logic to assist me with the problems.

As a first prroject, I enjoyed it very much. I found web development to be intriguing and I hope to pursue this as my future career.
